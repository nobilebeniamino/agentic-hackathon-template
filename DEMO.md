# Demo Video

Please record a 3â€“5 minute walkthrough showing:

- The problem you solve  
- End-to-end agent behavior on a representative example  
- Highlighted "agentic" steps (planning, tool calls, memory use)

### Demo Content Overview

This video demonstrates the **AI First Response** agentic emergency system built entirely on **Google Cloud Platform**:

- **Core Technology**: Google Gemini AI with Planner-Executor-Memory architecture
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud Run deployment with Google Cloud SQL persistence
- **Integration**: Google Maps API for location services and real-time emergency APIs
- **Autonomous Behavior**: Three AI agents collaborate to analyze, plan, and respond to emergencies

### Key Agentic Features Demonstrated

- **PLANNER**: Google Gemini analyzes emergency situations and creates structured action plans
- **EXECUTOR**: Autonomous tool calling to external APIs (USGS, GDACS) and Google Cloud services
- **MEMORY**: Pattern storage and retrieval from Google Cloud SQL database for contextual learning
- **ORCHESTRATION**: Seamless coordination between all three agents for comprehensive emergency response
- **RESILIENCE**: Graceful degradation when planning fails on ambiguous inputs
